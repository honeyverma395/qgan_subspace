"""Target hamiltonian module — PennyLane rewrite.

Replaces the manual Kronecker-product term_* functions with PennyLane
Pauli operators, and uses qml.matrix(qml.exp(H)) for the unitary.
The original code built Hamiltonians manually with Kronecker products of
2×2 Pauli matrices, PennyLane replaces all of that with qml.PauliX(i) @ qml.PauliZ(j)
syntax, and qml.exp(H, coeff=-1j) for the matrix exponential.

Unchanged:
    get_target_unitary(target_type, size) 
    get_final_target_state(input_state)    

This module constructs the "answer" that the generator is trying to learn.
Given a Hamiltonian H, we compute the time-evolution operator U = e^{-iH}
and apply it to one half of a maximally entangled state (Choi representation).
